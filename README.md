**Machine Learning project involving CNN for image generation of Chinese Calligraphy evaluating with binary cross entropy.**


A machine learning project involving autoregressive model using Gate Residual Network  and  CNN for 42,1000JPG images used for training and 10,500 JPG images used for testing the CNN models. 
Created CNN models generate the Chinese calligraphy based on pixel values binarization of 42100JPG image files , after converting images to grayscale image, with a threshold value of 0.33. 
Hence, returned with a binary cross entropy loss value of 0.1805 at the end of model evaluation.
